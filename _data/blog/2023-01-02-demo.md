# Your idea isn’t as unique as you think.

You may think you’ve got something novel, but in fact, your idea is a response to a lot of common realities and market forces being exerted on everyone, not just you. Even ideas that are wildly successful aren’t necessarily new. Google is a breakaway business in the world, but it wasn’t the world’s first search engine. This doesn’t mean you should give up now and stop pursuing your dream — but sharing your idea will help you uncover competition you may not have thought of, or assist you to give your idea shape and differentiation.
